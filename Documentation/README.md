# SOC Analyst Project

This project demonstrates the capabilities of a Security Operations Center (SOC). It includes detection rules for various attacks, attack simulations, automated response scripts, and SIEM configuration. The project is intended for SOC analysts and cybersecurity professionals aiming to monitor, detect, and respond to security events in real-time.

## Project Overview

This repository contains:

- Sigma detection rules for attack techniques such as Brute Force, Process Injection, and Suspicious DNS Queries.
- Attack simulation scripts to mimic real-world threats.
- Automated response scripts for threat mitigation.
- SIEM (Elastic Stack) configuration to collect, analyze, and visualize logs.

## Features

- **Sigma Rules**: Detection rules for common attack techniques, implemented in Sigma format.
- **Attack Simulations**: Scripts to simulate various attacks for testing detection rules.
- **Automated Response**: Scripts to automatically block IP addresses or take other actions when attacks are detected.
- **SIEM Integration**: Configuration for Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana) to collect and visualize data from endpoints.
- **Reporting**: Documentation detailing the project and testing results.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Install **Elastic Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for SIEM capabilities.
- Ensure you have **PowerShell** or **Bash** for running simulation and automation scripts.

### Steps to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SOC-Analyst-Project.git
   cd SOC-Analyst-Project
   ```

Set up Elastic Stack according to the configuration provided in SIEM-Config.

Run attack simulations using the scripts in Attack-Simulations.

Review alerts in Kibana and check for triggered events based on your Sigma rules.

Test the automated response scripts to ensure they work properly.
